## Overview

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://firstprojectm1.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

I still don't feel confident using CSS, I just learned it, I would like to improve my skills with flexbox and learn more about how to make responsive websites.

### Useful resources

- [{ Box-sizing: Border-box } FTW](https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/) - This helped me because it allowed me to add padding and margin to my child elements without affecting the size of the parent. I really liked this pattern and will use it in the future. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
